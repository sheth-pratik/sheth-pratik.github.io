<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Pratik Sheth, born in Surat city of Gujarat, India and currently working as Senior Developer at RIB Software AG at Guangzhou, China. I have experience in various .Net technologies and in Android (as hobby). I have done M. Sc. (I. T.) from India.
</p>
<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<h3>Education</h3>
I have done MSc IT from Veer Narmad South Gujarat University after completing 12th In Science stream. Apart from this I have also go MS in Software Engineer from BITS, Pilani as work integrated learning programme (WILP).
<p><h3>Work experience</h3>
<h4>Professional Experience</h4></p>
<p>I have experience of more then 6 years primarily in Microsoft .Net technologies. I am also interested in Android and I have already created two applications in Android, and one of them is already release on Play Store.</p>
<p>After completion of college study, I joined Patni computers (which was acquired by iGATE computers while I was working, which currently is acquired by Capgemini). I joined this company as fresher and was fortunate enough to start handling modules independently. I joined that company as Associate Software Engineer, but when I left it after 3 years; I was Senior Software Engineer with the help of 3 consecutive promotions in 3 appraisals. I (and my team) also won various awards. (Valuable Contribution Award, Dream Team, etc.) </p>
<p>After 3 years I joined Cygnet Infotech) comparatively small company in Ahmedabad. Where I got chance to work for a UK based company dealing with traffic management systems for various European and APEC region countries). Here I got chance to work and understand various technologies and concepts related Geographic Information System (GIS). I got chance to create a end to end complex real time system with various technologies like OpenLayers, SignalR, WCF duplex binding to name a few. First time I got chance to design and implement real time full stack application. <br/>
After that I joined another small company in Ahmedabad, where I was introduced to the various new concepts (for me) like GIT, TDD, micro services, SOLID principles, Web API, etc.</p>
<p>I was exploring good opportunities outside India, and when I got offer from RIB Software to work in it's R&D center at Guangzhou, China; I immediately accepted it. It has been a year since I left India, and enjoying very different and unique culture in China. Here I am working in various technologies like ASP.Net MVC, Web API, AngularJS, SQL, PowerShell.</p>
<h4>Hobbyist Experience</h4>
<p>I am also fascinated by Android. The way it is dominating current smart phone market with it's open and flexible approach is truly phenomenal. I have already published one android application "Multi Time Zone Clock" on Play Store. <a href="multi_time_zone_clock">Click here</a> to check it out.</p>
<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>
    I am married and became father of beautiful daughter "Hastee" (means Existance or always smiling) in this September. Unfortunately my wife and daughter are still leaving in India :( . Hopefully they will be in China soon! :)
